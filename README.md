Steps involved in this project:

Data Exploration:
Identify skewness and outliers in the dataset to understand and mitigate potential data irregularities.

Data Transformation and Cleaning:
Transform the data into a suitable format, conducting necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Regression Model Implementation:
Utilize machine learning to implement a regression model that predicts the continuous variable 'Selling_Price,' incorporating advanced ML techniques and storing the best model in pickle file.

Classification Model Development:
Create a machine learning classification model focused on predicting the Status (WON or LOST) of leads, and storing the best model in pickle file.

Streamlit Interface Creation:
Develop a user-friendly Streamlit web page allowing users to input values for each column. The page provides predicted values for Selling_Price and Status (Won/Lost), offering a convenient and interactive interface for users.
